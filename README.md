# text-circle-editor

This app is deployed here https://guarded-savannah-51094.herokuapp.com/

This is my most recent web application. It was created in Meteor.js, with JQuery, routing in the form of iron:router, MongoDB for handling the database and Bootstrap.js to make everything neat and responsive.

It is allows for HTML to be typed into the code editor and it will be rendered live in the display window, which is just an iFrame. It enables people to collaborate on coding assignments with others, they can add comments and see which users are editing the document. Users also have the option to make a document private, whereby JavaScript security measures disable other users from seeing the document. There is no limit to how many documents can be created or how many comments can be made.
